The Cloudflight Coding Contest (CCC) is an annual competitive programming event organized by Cloudflight, where participants tackle coding challenges in a competitive, timed environment. It attracts both students and professionals and is held worldwide, either in person at partner universities and institutions or online. Here's an overview of its key features:

# 1 - Problem Solving and Coding
Participants solve algorithmic problems in a set time frame (usually around four hours). Problems can vary widely in difficulty, allowing both beginners and experts to participate.

# 2 - Programming Language Choice
Participants can choose from a variety of programming languages, making it flexible and inclusive for coders with different preferences.

# 3 - Levels and Prizes
The CCC usually has multiple rounds, and the top performers are often awarded prizes, internships, or job opportunities. There are leaderboards for local and global standings, adding an extra competitive element.

# 4 - Networking and Exposure
For many, it's also a chance to network with peers, showcase skills to potential employers, and gain experience in competitive coding.
